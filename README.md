# Unlabelled Time-Series Analysis

This project analyzes a large, unlabelled multivariate time-series dataset containing 8,688 observations and 56 features, with no timestamps, labels, or business context provided.

The goal is to demonstrate how to approach ambiguous data by:
- Investigating structure before modeling  
- Forming and testing hypotheses from observed behavior  
- Identifying regime changes, redundancy, and temporal dependence  
- Evaluating short-term predictive potential  

The repository contains:
- A detailed exploratory and statistical analysis notebook  
- A written report summarizing methodology, insights, and conclusions for non-technical audiences
